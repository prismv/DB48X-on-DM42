# Bitwise operations

Bitwise operations represent bit-manipulation operations such as rotations and
shifts. They operate on [based numbers](#based-numbers),
[integers](#integers) or [big integers](#big-integers). When operating on based
numbers, the operation happens on the number of bits defined by the
[WordSize](#wordsize) setting. For integer values, the maximum number of bits is
defined by the [MaxNumberBits](#maxnumberbits) setting.

## ShiftLeft (SL)

Shift the value left by one bit.

`Value` ▶ `Value*2`

## ShiftLeftByte (SLB)

Shift the value left by one byte (8 bits).

`Value` ▶ `Value*256`

## ShiftLeftCount (SLC)

Shift the value left by a given number of bits.

`Value` `Shift` ▶ `Value*2^Shift`

## ShiftRight (SR)

Shift the value right by one bit.

`Value` ▶ `Value/2`

## ShiftRightByte (SRB)

Shift the value right by one byte (8 bits).

`Value` ▶ `Value/256`

## ShiftRightCount (SRC)

Shift the value right by a given number of bits.

`Value` `Shift` ▶ `Value/2^Shift`

## ArithmeticShiftRight (ASR)

Shift the value right by one bit, preserving the sign bit.

`Value` ▶ `Signed(Value)/2`

## ArithmeticShiftRightByte (ASRB)

Shift the value right by one byte (8 bits), preserving the sign bit.

`Value` ▶ `Signed(Value)/256`

## ArithmeticShiftRightCount (ASRC)

Shift the value right by a given number of bits, preserving the sign bit.

`Value` `Shift` ▶ `Signed(Value)/2^Shift`

## RotateLeft (RL)

Rotate the value left by one bit.

`Value`  ▶ `RLC(Value, 1)`


## RotateLeftByte (RLB)

Rotate the value left by one byte (8 bits).

`Value`  ▶ `RL(Value, 8)`

## RotateLeftCount (RLC)

Rotate the value left by a given number of bits.

`Value`  `Shift` ▶ `RLC(Value, Shift)`


## RotateRight (RR)

Rotate the value right by one bit.

`Value`  ▶ `RRC(Value, 1)`

## RotateRightByte (RRB)

Rotate the value right by one byte (8 bits).

`Value`  ▶ `RRC(Value, 8)`

## RotateRightCount (RRC)

Rotate the value right by a given number of bits.

`Value` `Shift` ▶ `RRC(Value, Shift)`

# Logical operations

Logical operations operate on [truth values](#boolean-values).
They can either operate on numbers, where a non-zero value represent `True` and
a zero value represents `False`. On [based numbers](#based-numbers), they
operate bitwise on the number of bits defined by the [WordSize](#wordsize)
setting.

## Or

Logical inclusive "or" operation: the result is true if either input is true.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y or X`


## And

Logical "and" operation: the result is true if both inputs are true.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y and X`

## Xor

Logical exclusive "or" operation: the result is true if exactly one input is
true.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y xor X`


## Not

Logical "not" operation: the result is true if the input is false.

`X` ▶ `not X`


## NAnd

Logical "not and" operation: the result is true unless both inputs are true.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y nand X`


## NOr

Logical "not or" operation: the result is true unless either input is true.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y nor X`

## Implies

Logical implication operation: the result is true if the first input is false or
the second input is true.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y implies X`

## Equiv

Logical equivalence operation: the result is true if both inputs are true or
both inputs are false.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y equiv X`

## Excludes

Logical exclusion operation: the result is true if the first input is true or
the second input is false.

`Y` `X` ▶ `Y excludes X`
